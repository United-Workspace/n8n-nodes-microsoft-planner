# n8n-nodes-microsoft-planner

This is an n8n community node that allows you to interact with Microsoft Planner in your n8n workflows.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

[Microsoft Planner](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/task-management-software) is a task management tool that helps teams organize, assign, and collaborate on tasks.

**Note**: Once a comment is posted in Planner, it cannot be deleted or edited via the Microsoft Graph API or the Planner UI (for Basic plans). This is a limitation of the Microsoft 365 Groups conversation system that Planner uses.

### Working with Plans

The **Plan** resource allows you to manage Microsoft Planner plans:

- **Create**: Requires an **Owner Group** (selected from dropdown or entered as ID) and a **Title**.
- **Get Many**:
  - **My Plans**: Lists plans the authenticated user is a member of.
  - **Group Plans**: Requires a **Group ID** to list plans owned by that specific group.
- **Get**: Retrieve full plan metadata. Enable **Include Details** to get category descriptions (labels) and other metadata.
- **Update**:
  - Change the plan **Title**.
  - **Category Descriptions**: Update the labels for the 25 color-coded categories (Category 1-25).
  - **Shared With**: Update plan members using a JSON mapping of user IDs.
- **Delete**: Permanently removes the plan.

### Working with Buckets

The **Bucket** resource manages the columns or categories within a plan:

- **Create**: Requires a **Plan ID** and a **Name**.
  - **Upsert**: When enabled, the node will check if a bucket with the same name already exists in the plan and return that instead of creating a duplicate.
- **Get Many**: Lists all buckets within a specific **Plan ID**.
- **Update**: Change the bucket **Name** and its **Order Hint** (controlling the position in the UI).
- **Delete**: Removes the bucket from the plan.

### How to Find Plan IDs

You can find your Plan ID in several ways:

1. **From Planner URL**: Open Microsoft Planner in browser, the URL contains the Plan ID:
   ```
   https://tasks.office.com/.../ planId=YOUR_PLAN_ID_HERE /...
   ```

2. **Via Microsoft Graph Explorer**:
   - Go to https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer
   - Sign in
   - Run: `GET /me/planner/plans`
   - Copy the `id` field from the plan you want

### Resource Locator (From List / By ID)

When creating tasks or filtering by bucket:
- **From List**: Select from dropdown (automatically loads based on Plan ID)
- **By ID**: Manually enter the ID if you already know it

For Get/Update/Delete operations, you need to manually enter the Task ID.
